Binding or bound is a common word used to indicate connection, linkage, or association between two objects. In Haskell we'll use it to talk about what value a variable has, e.g. a parameter variable is bound to an argument value, meaning the value is passed into the parameter as input and each occurrence of that named parameter will have the same value. Bindings as a plurality will usually refer to a collection of variables and functions which can be referenced by name.
```haskell
blah :: Int
blah = 10
```
Here the variable blah is bound to the value 10.
