A function is a mathematical object whose capabilities are limited to being applied to an argument and returning a result. Functions can be described as a list of ordered pairs of their inputs and outputs, like a mapping. Given the function of f x = x + 2 applied to the argument 2, we would have the ordered pair (2, 4) of its input and output.
