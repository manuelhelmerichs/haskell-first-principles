A tuple is an ordered grouping of values. In Haskell, you cannot have a tuple with only one element, but there is a zero tuple also called unit or (). The types of the elements of tuples are allowed to vary, so you can have both (String, String) or (Integer, String). Tuples in Haskell are the usual means of briefly carrying around multiple values without giving that combination its own name.
