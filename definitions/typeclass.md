A typeclass is a means of expressing faculties or interfaces that multiple datatypes may have in common. This enables us to write code exclusively in terms of those commonalities without repeating yourself for each instance. Just as one may sum values of type Int, Integer, Float, Double, and Rational, we can avoid having different (+), (\*), (-), negate etc. functions for each by unifying them into a single typeclass. Importantly, these can then be used with all types that have a Num instance. Thus, a typeclass provides us a means to write code in terms of those operators and have our functions be compatible with all types that have instances of that typeclass, whether they already exist or are yet to be invented (by you, perhaps).

A typeclass is a set of operations defined with respect to a polymorphic type. When a type has an instance of a typeclass, values of that type can be used in the standard operations defined for that typeclass. In Haskell, typeclasses are unique pairings of class and concrete instance. This means that if a given type a has an instance of Eq, it has only one instance of Eq.
