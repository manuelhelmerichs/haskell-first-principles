The terms argument and parameter are often used interchangeably. However, it is worthwhile to understand the distinction. A parameter, or formal parameter, represents a value that will be passed to the function when the function is called. Thus, parameters are usually variables. An argument is an input value the function is applied to. A function's parameter is bound to the value of an argument when the function is applied to that argument. For example, in f x = x + 2 which takes an argument and returns that value added to 2, x is the one parameter of our function. We run the code by applying f to some argument. If the argument we passed to the parameter x were 2, our result would be 4. However, arguments can themselves be variables or be expressions that include variables, thus the distinction is not always clear.
