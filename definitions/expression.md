An expression is a combination of symbols that conforms to syntactic rules and can be evaluated to some result. In Haskell, an expression is a well-structured combination of constants, variables, and functions. While irreducible constants are technically expressions, we usually refer to those as "values", so we usually mean "reducible expression" when we use the term expression.
